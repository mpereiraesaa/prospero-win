/*
 * A per-module working directory for Wine's Unix side on PS5.
 *
 * A title may not change its working directory: chdir() is EPERM for every
 * path and libc's getcwd() faults (FW 12.02). Wine relies on one anyway:
 * ntdll enters the prefix to create dosdevices and lists directories through
 * fchdir, and wineserver saves the registry from its configuration and
 * server directories. pw_wine_cwd_libc.c wraps those calls (lld --wrap) and
 * resolves relative paths against the directory kept here. Each module links
 * its own copy, so the in-process wineserver has its own directory, as the
 * separate server process has on other hosts.
 *
 * The directory is logical: chdir() folds "." and ".." lexically, like a
 * shell's cd. Paths passed to other calls are only joined to it; the kernel
 * resolves them, so symbolic links keep their meaning.
 *
 * A title cannot create symbolic links either: symlink() is libkernel_sys
 * only, and a system call from title code kills the process (FW 12.02,
 * PPRBUG-22859). Wine needs two, dosdevices/c: -> ../drive_c and z: -> /, so
 * links are virtual: kept here, followed by every wrapped call, and saved in
 * a PW_CWD_LINK_TABLE file in the link's directory, which is read the first
 * time a lookup below that directory fails.
