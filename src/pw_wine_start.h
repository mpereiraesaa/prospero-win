/*
 * In-process start of Wine's Unix side from a PS5 title.
 *
 * The title loads ntdll as a PRX (the firmware does not run its module_start
 * and cannot name it for dladdr), resolves its entry points through the
 * module's PRXDESC1 descriptor, prepares Wine's environment and enters
 * __wine_main on a dedicated thread, since __wine_main never returns. No
 * process is created and nothing is executed from a file system path.
 *
 * Kernel and libc calls are injected so the sequence is host-testable.
